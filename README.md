git code, I use often but never remember 

#### Don't Forget
- git reset --hard HEAD~1 (removes the last commit)
- rm -rf .git (removes tracking, but you may have to delete the git folder)
- CMD + shift + . (to see hidden files on MacOS like the git folder)
- touch .gitignore (creating gitIgnore file in repo)]
- git rm --cached FILENAME (to remove a particular file that has been added to the remote repo, filename should be file path)



#### Adding Stuff to gitignore
- just drag the file into the .gitignore txt window, remove /Users/Ibukunoluwa blah blah 
- for individual files just use the file name
- then add, commit and push :)
