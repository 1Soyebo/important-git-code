# important-git-code
git code, I use often but never remember 

#### Don't Forget
- git reset --hard HEAD~1 (removes the last commit)
_ rm -rf .git (removes tracking, but you may have to delete the git folder)
- CMD + shift + . (to see hidden files on MacOS like the git folder)
- touch .gitignore (creating gitIgnore file in repo)


#### Adding Stuff to gitignore
- just drag the file into the .gitignore txt window, remove /Users/Ibukunoluwa blah blah 
- then add, commit and push :)
